Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project leverages various machine learning techniques to build a model that can accurately classify the species based on their measurements.

Project Overview
The Iris flower classification problem is a classic dataset used in pattern recognition. The dataset includes the following features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
These features are used to classify the flowers into one of three species:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize features, and split the data into training and test sets.
Model Training: Train different classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) to find the best model for this classification task.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Saving: Save the best-performing model for future use.
